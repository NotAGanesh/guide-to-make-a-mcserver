## How to Make a Minecraft Server Guide 🧩
1. Download [Fork Minecraft Server Manager UI](https://www.fork.gg/)
2. Open Fork, click on the Forge style icon & Create a Server (Choice Game Version, Server Software)

> [!TIP]
> For optimal performance, consider using **PaperMC**.

4. Download [Playit.gg](https://playit.gg/) Now make a agent, then create a Tunnel for **Minecraft: Java Edition** (Use Local Address: `127.0.0.1`, Port: `25565`)
5. Now Download [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/download). Plugin & [Floodgate](https://geysermc.org/download#floodgate). Plugin

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Ensure your GeyserMC plugin matches your Minecraft server version (e.g., **1.21, 1.16.5, etc**.) and your server software (e.g., **PaperMC, Spigot, etc**.).
6. After you downloaded the plugin, copy the `Geyser-Spigot.jar`, in my case the file named spigot, don't worry if the file named `Geyser-Fabric` or any other.
7. Paste the file in `Your-Server\plugins` folder, if the folder is not there then paste the file in `Your-Server\mods` folder, Because the Folder names is different according to your server software

## Let's make the server Cross-platform

Done!
